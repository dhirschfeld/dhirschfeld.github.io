          About Me
        </h3>

        <p>
        An electrical engineer by training, my career has turned out to be focused
        around software development - most recently in the quantitative finance domain.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm a passionate exponent of Python as a programming language for
        quantitative/scientific development not the least because of the large
        ecosystem of open source scientific libraries and thriving community. Building
        on top of world-class code battle-tested by thousands of people
        worldwide allows you to focus on the value-added aspect of your job/industry
        without reinventing the wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a software engineer concerned with the the full lifecycle of code,
        maintenability is an extremely important aspect for me and Python's culture
        is as important in this regard as is its clear, concise and understandable syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
        When not evangelising Python I occasionally program in C# and have maintained
        an interest in C++ despite not having found the need  to resort to it for many
        years!
